# Enforce Password

## Introductory Paragraph

The tutorial will provide a breakdown of the regex to enforce password requirements. This regex checks a string to meet password requirements. The tutorial will show the components of the regex and how they function together.

## Summary

This is a tutorial about the regex /(?=(.[0-9]))((?=.[A-Za-z0-9])(?=.[A-Z])(?=.[a-z]))^.{8,}$/. This regex is used to enforce password policies.

Lookahead for Digits: (?=.*[0-9]) ensures the password includes at least one numeric digit.

Lookaheads for Alphanumeric and Case Sensitivity:

(?=.*[A-Za-z0-0]) verifies the presence of at least one alphanumeric character.
(?=.*[A-Z]) requires at least one uppercase letter.
(?=.*[a-z]) demands at least one lowercase letter.
Length Requirement: ^.{8,}$ ensures the password is at least 8 characters long.

These elements implement a regex that enforces strong password standards by ensuring a combination of alphanumeric characters, uppercase and lowercase letteres, and a minimum length of 8 characters.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
In the regex /^(?=.[0-9])((?=.[A-Za-z0-9])(?=.[A-Z])(?=.[a-z]))^.{8,}$/, the anchors play an important role in determining where and how the pattern is applied within a string:

^: This anchor signifies the start of the line, ensuring that the regex pattern matches from the very beginning of the string. It indicates that password validation begins at the start of the input. 

$: This anchor denotes the end of the line, ensuring that the regex pattern extends to the end of the string. It means the entire string must conform to the specified pattern.
