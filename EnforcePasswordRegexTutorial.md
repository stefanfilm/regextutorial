# Enforce Password

## Introductory Paragraph

The tutorial will provide a breakdown of the regex to enforce password requirements. This regex checks a string to meet password requirements. The tutorial will show the components of the regex and how they function together.

## Summary

This is a tutorial about the regex /(?=(.[0-9]))((?=.[A-Za-z0-9])(?=.[A-Z])(?=.[a-z]))^.{8,}$/. This regex is used to enforce password policies.

Lookahead for Digits: (?=.*[0-9]) ensures the password includes at least one numeric digit.

Lookaheads for Alphanumeric and Case Sensitivity:

(?=.*[A-Za-z0-0]) verifies the presence of at least one alphanumeric character.
(?=.*[A-Z]) requires at least one uppercase letter.
(?=.*[a-z]) demands at least one lowercase letter.
Length Requirement: ^.{8,}$ ensures the password is at least 8 characters long.

These elements implement a regex that enforces strong password standards by ensuring a combination of alphanumeric characters, uppercase and lowercase letteres, and a minimum length of 8 characters.

## Regex Components

### Anchors
In the regex /^(?=.[0-9])((?=.[A-Za-z0-9])(?=.[A-Z])(?=.[a-z]))^.{8,}$/, the anchors play an important role in determining where and how the pattern is applied within a string:

^: This anchor signifies the start of the line, ensuring that the regex pattern matches from the very beginning of the string. It indicates that password validation begins at the start of the input. 

$: This anchor denotes the end of the line, ensuring that the regex pattern extends to the end of the string. It means the entire string must conform to the specified pattern. 

### Quantifiers
Quantifiers are essential in regular expressions, acting as the architects of repetition within a pattern. These special characters define how many times a specific character or group of characters should appear in a regex pattern. This flexibility to adjust patterns based on varying occurrences makes quantifiers invaluable for tasks such as pattern matching and text manipulation.

The quantifier {8,} specifies a range, requiring at least 8 characters in the password. 

### Grouping Constructs
Grouping constructs are used to "capture" or extract specific segments of a matched string. In the regex /^(?=.[0-9])((?=.[A-Za-z0-9])(?=.[A-Z])(?=.[a-z]))^.{8,}$/, there are no grouping constructs present.

### Bracket Expressions
Bracket expressions define acceptable characters for a specific part of a pattern. They are enclosed in square brackets, [ and ]. Within these brackets, a range expression consists of two characters separated by a hyphen, matching any single character within that range, inclusive. For example, the regex [0123456789] matches any single digit, while [^()] matches any single character except opening or closing parenthesis.

### Character Classes
Character classes, enclosed in square brackets [], match any single character contained within them. For instance, [A-Za-z0-9] matches any uppercase letter, lowercase letter, or digit.
